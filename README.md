# React App Boilerplate with Tailwind, MobX, and React Router DOM

This repository provides a boilerplate setup for a React application with Tailwind CSS, MobX for state management, and React Router DOM for routing. It aims to provide a starting point for building modern, scalable, and efficient web applications using React.

## Features

- React with create-react-app
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MobX for state management
- React Router DOM for routing
- Responsive navbar and footer

## Prerequisites

Before using this boilerplate, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the boilerplate:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading, use the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. Any changes made to the source code will automatically trigger a recompile and refresh the browser.

### Production Build

To create a production-ready build of the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate an optimized and minified build of your application in the `build` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your production server.

### Customization

This boilerplate is designed to provide a solid foundation for your React application. You can customize it to fit your specific needs. Here are a few areas you may want to explore:

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is integrated into the project, allowing you to easily customize the styling of your components. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for more information on how to use and customize Tailwind.

- **State Management**: MobX is set up as the state management solution in this boilerplate. You can create MobX stores and define observables, actions, and reactions to manage your application state. Refer to the MobX documentation for more details on how to work with MobX.

- **Routing**: React Router DOM is configured to handle routing in the application. You can define routes and navigation within your components using the provided routing setup. Refer to the React Router DOM documentation for information on how to set up and use React Router DOM.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the boilerplate is organized as follows:

```java
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── router/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
├── public/
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

- **src/components**: This directory contains the reusable React components of your application.
- **src/pages**: This directory contains the page-level components of your application.
- **src/router**: This directory contains the routing configuration and components.
- **src/App.js**: The entry point of your application where you can define the main component structure.
- **src/index.js**: The root file that renders the React application.
- **public**: This directory contains the static assets of your application.
- **package.json**: The npm package configuration file.
- **README.md**: The readme file with usage instructions.
- **.gitignore**: The Git ignore file to exclude specific files from version control.
  Feel free to adjust the folder structure and organization based on your project's requirements.
